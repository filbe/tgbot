# Telegram Bot on Diploi

## Installation

1. In **Telegram app**, find a user _BotFather_
2. Send `/newbot` command to it to create a new bot.
   It will ask a name of your bot.
   **Notice: Users can find your Telegram Bot by its name, so choose wisely!**
3. Then, _BotFather_ will send you an _HTTP API token_.
   Paste that token in Diploi Deployment environment variables.

**Notice: You should create one bot (token) for each Diploi Deployment**
(e.g. separate bots for _development_, _staging_, and _production_ environments respectively).
